        <div class="text_img"><p class="p2">The Google Pixel 6 Pro (starting at $899) is the company's most ambitious smartphone to date, and a major improvement over last year's Pixel 5. Now, the Pixel 5 was a fine phone, with an excellent camera, good performance, and a lot of value for the price, but it was also a bit boring. With the Pixel 6 Pro, Google overhauls everything inside and out. The phone sports a new Tensor chip that delivers superb performance, a vivid OLED panel, and a battery that lasts all day. It's the most expensive phone in Google's lineup, which includes the Pixel 6 (starting at $599) and the wallet-friendly Pixel 5a With 5G ($449), but it stands out as the best high-end Android you can buy right now, earning our Editors' Choice award for Android flagships.</p>
